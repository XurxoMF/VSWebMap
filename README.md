# Web Map for Vinstage Story

This webmap was designed for the Vaporwave Vintage Story server but now it can be used by everyone.

To get the map and markers you've to use WebCartographer mod by Th3Dilli.

I'll make a better guide in the future.

`npm run dockerize` to build for production and host using docker.

`npm run build-prod` to build for production and host using you local computer.

Can be accessed in `localhost`
